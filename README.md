#### 2. Business Case: Rental Bike Sharing EDA & Hypothesis Testing

Understanding the factors on which the demand for the shared electric cycles depends. Specifically, understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared electric cycles in the Indian market. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market? How well those variables describe the electric cycle demands.
Concept Used: Bi-Variate Analysis, 2-sample t-test: testing for difference across populations, ANNOVA, Chi-square

#### 3. CardioGoodFitness Case study

The market research team at Company wants to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the treadmills to the new customers. The team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.
1. Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill product by developing appropriate tables and charts.
2. For each AeroFit treadmill product, construct two-way contingency tables and compute all conditional and marginal probabilities along with their insights/impact on the business.

#### 4. Hospital Patient Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

As a data scientist working at Pharmacy company which provides services 24/7, the ultimate goal is to tease out meaningful and actionable insights from patient-level collected data. and helping company to be more efficient, to influence diagnostic and treatment processes, to map the spread of a pandemic. One of the best examples of data scientists making a meaningful difference at a global level is in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where they have improved information collection, provided ongoing and accurate estimates of infection spread and health system demand, and assessed the effectiveness of government policies. The company wants to know: • Which variables are significant in predicting the reason for hospitalization for different regions • How well some variables like viral load, smoking, Severity Level describe the hospitalization charges We need to analyse how different factors are impacting on hospitalization charges for patients with different parameters such as gender, smoking, viral load, severity level, age.

#### 5. Logistic Data - Feature Engineering

For largest and fastest-growing fully integrated logistic player in India by revenue in Fiscal 2021, They aim to build the operating system for commerce, through a combination of world-class infrastructure, logistics operations of the highest quality, and cutting-edge engineering and technology capabilities.
